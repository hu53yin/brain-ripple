## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** - To start contributing, first fork the BrainRipple repository to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to create a copy of the project and make changes without affecting the main repository.

2. **Clone your fork** - Clone your forked repository to your local machine so you can make changes and test the project locally. To clone the repository, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BrainRipple.git
```


3. **Create a new branch** - Before making any changes, create a new branch to keep your work organized and separate from the main branch. Name your branch based on the feature or fix you're working on:


```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```


## How to Contribute

1. **Pick an issue or feature request** - Look through the existing issues or feature requests on the repository. If you find one that you're interested in working on, leave a comment to let the maintainers and other contributors know that you'll be working on it. Check TODO.md for suggestions.

2. **Discuss your solution** - If you have questions or need guidance on how to implement a feature or fix a bug, feel free to ask in the issue or feature request thread. The maintainers and other contributors will be happy to help.

3. **Write your code** - Write your code following the best practices for the programming languages and technologies used in the project. Keep your code clean, well-organized, and well-commented to make it easy for other contributors to understand.

4. **Test your changes** - Make sure to test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request. This includes running the project's test suite and manually testing your changes in different browsers and environments.

5. **Commit your changes** - When you're ready to commit your changes, make sure to provide a clear and descriptive commit message. This will help other contributors understand the purpose of your changes.

```bash
git commit -m "Add a new feature or fix a bug"
